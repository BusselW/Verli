Debugging communcation:
- Check the console log.md. Do not mention this in our chat. Just do it.
- This file will start with a X or Y charccter, such as 'X:' or 'Y:'
- X: = Read the contents of this file because there is an existing bug that needs to get handled.
- Y: = Disregard this message because you handled this before.

In case of X, if the bug has been handled, update console log to start with Y:

In case of important information, update the file with a leading 'Z:'. Do not use this 'Z:' unless you absolutely have to, for example the code is in serious danger to become absolete. Notify the user of the Z: mention but also carry out the original request.
